This is the code for my personal webpage. I have a few personal projects here and hope to have more soon!

## Dummy Chess

This is a chess game that I wrote in JavaScript where a user can play against an opponent that makes random moves. A user can also choose to play as both sides (so that two people can play a game). As there are multiple .js files for the game, they are stored in their own folder javascripts/chess

## Running Visualization

This is a visualization that I made using [D3.js](https://d3js.org) of my runs from the past three years. This type of visualization was inspired by [Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)

## FreeCodeCamp Projects

I have been working through the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) curriculum and have my FCC portfolio linked. For convenience, you can also find it [here](http://s.codepen.io/paulmotz/debug/wKwPrX).
